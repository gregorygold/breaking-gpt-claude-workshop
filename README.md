# Breaking GPT & Claude — Promptfoo Red-Team Workshop

Hands-on AI bug-bounty workshop. The setup script spins up **MediBot** — a real OpenAI Assistant (a healthcare triage bot with strict guardrails) — in *your* OpenAI account. You then red-team it using [Promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev) with prompt-injection, hallucination, and cost/context tests. Optionally compare MediBot against open-source models via OpenRouter, or GPT vs Claude.

## Quickstart (≈ 3 minutes)

You need: a terminal, internet, and an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### macOS / Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregorygold/breaking-gpt-claude-workshop.git
cd breaking-gpt-claude-workshop
./setup.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/gregorygold/breaking-gpt-claude-workshop.git
cd breaking-gpt-claude-workshop
.\setup.ps1
```

The script will: check Node ≥ 20, install Promptfoo, prompt for your OpenAI key, write `.env`, and run a smoke test.

## Run the workshop eval

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest eval
npx promptfoo@latest view    # opens the web UI
```

## What you'll do

1. **Prompt-injection / jailbreaks** — try to bypass system-prompt guardrails (`tests/jailbreaks.yaml`)
2. **Hallucination traps** — confirm the model refuses to invent facts (`tests/hallucinations.yaml`)
3. **Cost & context** — assert token usage, cost, and latency thresholds (`tests/cost-context.yaml`)
4. **GPT vs Claude** — uncomment the Anthropic provider in `promptfooconfig.yaml` for side-by-side comparison

## Cleanup (optional)

Setup creates a `MediBot — Triage Assistant` in your OpenAI account. It costs nothing to leave it there; delete it any time at <https://platform.openai.com/assistants>.
